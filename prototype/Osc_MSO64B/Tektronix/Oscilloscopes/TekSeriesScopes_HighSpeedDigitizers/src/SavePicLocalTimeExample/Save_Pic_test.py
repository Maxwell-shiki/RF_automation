PyVISA 1.11
To get PyVISA: pip install pyvisa
Tested on MSO5/MSO6 (FW 1.24)
NI-VISA was used on PC.

This is a script that uses PyVISA to connect to an MSO5 or MSO6 series oscilloscope.
It will enable CH1, single trigger, and then transfer an inverted picture to a file location
on a remote PC.
