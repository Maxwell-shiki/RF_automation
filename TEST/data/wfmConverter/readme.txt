Description: ConvertTekWfm is a utility for converting TDS file system
      .WFM files, generated on a TDS5xxx/6xxx/7xxx, DPO7xxx and DPO/DSA 7xxxx 
      series scopes, into formats that may be more meaningful, useful, 
      or convenient to Tektronix customers.  Formats generated by this 
      version of ConvertTekWfm include an ASCII tabular-spaced text file, 
      an ASCII comma separated value (CSV) file, and both MATHCAD and 
      MATLAB files (also ASCII files with a .dat file extension).
	
Note: The formats produced by this utility are identical to those
      exported by TekScope when a waveform is exported from the File
      menu of the application.

Usage: ConvertTekWfm [ /? | InputFile [ /TXT | /CSV | /MCAD | /MLAB ] [OutputFile] ]

Normal Use: ConvertTekWfm requires a minimum of two command-line 
      arguments.  The first is the name and/or location of the .WFM
      file you wish to convert.  The second argument specifies the
      format you'd like the .WFM file to be converted into.

      /TXT - tabular-spaced text file
      /CSV - comma separated value file
      /MCAD - MathCAD file
      /MLAB - MATLAB file

      The third argument, which is optional, specifies the name 
      and/or location of the converted .WFM file that ConvertTekWfm
      outputs.  If this argument is not specified, ConvertTekWfm 
      will use the preexisting file name of the .WFM file, only 
      with a file extension appropriate to the format of the 
      converted file (.txt for tabular-spaced text files, .csv
      for comma separated value files, and .dat for MathCAD and
      MATLAB files).
